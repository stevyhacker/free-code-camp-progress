        Android is a mobile operating system (OS) currently
        developed by Google, based on the Linux kernel and designed primarily for touchscreen mobile
        devices such as smartphones and tablets. Android's user interface is mainly based on direct
        manipulation, using touch gestures that loosely correspond to real-world actions, such as
        swiping, tapping and pinching, to manipulate on-screen objects, along with a virtual
        keyboard for text input. In addition to touchscreen devices, Google has further developed
        Android TV for televisions, Android Auto for cars, and Android Wear for wrist watches, each
        with a specialized user interface. Variants of Android are also used on notebooks, game
        consoles, digital cameras, and other electronics.
